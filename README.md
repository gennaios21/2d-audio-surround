# This is a software that simulates audio sources in the 3D space, by placing a sound source around the listener. The sound source can be either static, meaning the sources have fixed positions, or dynamic, in which case the source can move around, in a 360-degree circle surrounding the listener.

# It is written in Python 3.11. First, install the required packages by running `pip install sounddevice, soundfile, numpy`

# Then, run the `vbap_gui.py` file, either with `python vbap_gui.py` or in your IDE
